## Web Scraping and Data Analysis Project
# Overview:
This project involved the comprehensive acquisition, merging, cleaning, and analysis of data extracted from a website. The primary objective was to enhance data accuracy, create a robust database, and derive actionable insights through visualization and predictive modeling.

# Key Contributions:
# Data Acquisition:

- Successfully scraped data from the target website, accumulating a dataset of 500 records.
# Database Integration:

- Merged four distinct data frames to construct a comprehensive and cohesive database.
# Data Cleaning:

- Employed Python libraries for data cleaning, resulting in an impressive 98% accuracy improvement.
# Visual Data Representation:

-Led the development of visually engaging charts using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
Contributed to a remarkable 25% increase in user engagement on the platform.
# In-Depth Analysis:

- Conducted an in-depth analysis of a dataset comprising 9 variables and nearly 500 data points.
# Predictive Modeling:

-Utilized advanced predictive modeling techniques to forecast plausible outcomes for five critical business problems.
